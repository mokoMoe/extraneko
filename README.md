This is a edit of a cdda mod named extra_mut_scen by Saicchi.

**DISCLAIMER: This mod originally is not made by me, so if you are the author and want this to be deleted, just contact me.**

(and also sorry for my english)

So here are the changes:
- I just did it so that now it would be possible to select all professions, not only the ones that mod allows.
- Oh and also i added pretty trait... somewhere.

Maybe later i will make this mod more original, but i just needed original mod for an example how to mod.
And idea that behind it is that i saw a mod that makes it possible to start as wolf/cat/etc people, but on last experimental version it didnt worked
so at first i decided to port that mod, but then i thought easier would be to change this mod.
